We need to investigate why the .chat custom document views are not showing properly in the VS Code app. The file at src/commands/ConversationDocumentsCommand.ts implements this functionality but it is large, so you'll need to create a few tasks to figure out what's going on:
1. Get a line count of the file
2. create a task for every 100 lines of code
3. title the task: Investigate Lines 1-100 to find out why chat document view isnt showing, Investigate Lines 101-200 to find out why chat document view isnt showing, etc.
4. For each of these tasks, use sed to list out the lines of code you're investigating. For example, for the first task, you'd run `sed -n 1,100p src/commands/ConversationDocumentsCommand.ts`
5. Once you have found the issue, then create a file called temp_found.txt and put the line number and description of the issue in that file. For example, if you found the issue on line 150, then you'd put "Line 150: The issue is that the blah blah blah is not blah blah blah"
6. Create one more task to review the temp_found.txt file and create a bug for each issue you found.
